# Geodesic Distances

Geodesic distance, also known as shortest-path distance or distance along a curve, is a measure of the shortest path between two points on a curved surface or manifold.

In contrast to Euclidean distance, which measures the straight-line distance between two points in a flat space, geodesic distance accounts for the curvature of the surface and takes into account the shortest path that follows the surface.

In machine learning and data analysis, geodesic distance is often used in manifold learning techniques, such as Isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP), to estimate the underlying structure of a dataset that is assumed to lie on a nonlinear manifold. By approximating the geodesic distance between data points, these techniques can project high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving the underlying structure of the manifold.

Calculating geodesic distances on a curved surface or manifold can be a complex task and requires knowledge of the geometry of the surface. In some cases, an exact analytical solution may not be available, and numerical methods may be required to approximate the distance.

One common approach to approximate geodesic distances is to use graph-based methods, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, to find the shortest path between two points on a graph that approximates the manifold. This involves constructing a graph of the data points, where each point is connected to its nearest neighbors, and then finding the shortest path between the two points along the edges of the graph.

Another approach is to use optimization methods to find the shortest path between two points on the manifold. This involves minimizing the length of a curve that connects the two points, subject to constraints that ensure the curve lies on the manifold.

Overall, the approach for calculating geodesic distances depends on the specific surface or manifold being considered and the desired level of accuracy.
