The mathematical derivation of kernel PCA involves several steps, including the kernel trick, eigenvalue decomposition, and the projection of the data onto the principal components.


1. Kernel trick: The first step in kernel PCA is to apply a kernel function to the input data. The kernel function transforms the data into a higher-dimensional feature space, where it may be linearly separable. The most commonly used kernel function is the radial basis function (RBF) kernel, which is defined as follows:
   $k(x, y) = exp(-\gamma ||x-y||^2)$
   where $x$ and y are input data points, gamma is a hyperparameter that controls the width of the kernel, and $||.||$ denotes the Euclidean distance between two points. Other kernel functions, such as the polynomial kernel and sigmoid kernel, can also be used.
2. Eigenvalue decomposition: Once the kernel matrix $K$ is computed, we can perform eigenvalue decomposition on K to obtain the principal components of the data. The eigenvalue decomposition of $K$ is given by:
   $K = V * \Lambda * V^T$
   where V is a matrix of eigenvectors, $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and $V^T$ is the transpose of $V$. The eigenvectors correspond to the principal components of the data, and the eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each principal component.
3. Projection onto principal components: To reduce the dimensionality of the data, we project the data onto the first $k$ principal components, where $k$ is the desired number of dimensions in the reduced space. The projection of the data onto the principal components is given by:
   $X_{pca} = V[:, :k]^T * K$
   where $V[:, :k]$ is a matrix of the first $k$ eigenvectors, and $X_{pca}$ is the matrix of projected data points in the reduced space.
4. Centering the data: Before performing kernel PCA, we need to center the data by subtracting the mean of the input data from each data point. This is because kernel PCA assumes that the data is centered around the origin.
